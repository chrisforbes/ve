[x] Basic voxel rendering
[x] Support loading a .vox
[x] Non-cube bounding volumes
[x] Use proper voxel palette
[x] Integrate dear imgui so we can have some debug controls
[x] Render offscreen
[x] Add depth visualization mode
[x] Allow transforming the volume
[x] Factor model transform out so we can have multiple volumes
[x] Draw multiple models

[ ] First person camera
[ ] Compute proper depth
[ ] Splat the voxel models into a global map for GI/shadows/etc
[ ] Integrate physics system
[ ] Object splitting
    - Do union-find across the voxel field
    - Maintain multiple subobjects in the same field? Keep additional subobjectid field?
        - Requires ping-ponged subobjectid fields to prevent accidental fusing -- connectivity is based on
          old subobjectids matching
    - How does any of this work in a material-aware way?
        - Single-voxel 'Bolts' as cross-material connectivity?

[x] Basic voxel rendering
[x] Support loading a .vox
[x] Non-cube bounding volumes
[x] Use proper voxel palette
[x] Integrate dear imgui so we can have some debug controls
[x] Render offscreen
[x] Add depth visualization mode
[x] Allow transforming the volume
[x] Factor model transform out so we can have multiple volumes

[ ] Compute proper depth
[ ] Splat the voxel models into a global map for GI/shadows/etc
